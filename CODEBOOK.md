### VARIABLES

## Activity (categorical variable):## describes  activity was doing the subject when the measure was taken. The activities are the following: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS and WALKING_UPSTAIRS.

## Subject_ID (integer variable):## there were 30 subjects, each subject an unique ID number between 1 and 30.

## Average_Time_Dom_BodyAcc_mean_X (numeric variable):## takes values between -1 and 1. It’s the average of the tBodyAcc-mean()-X variable of the original data set. 

## Average_Time_Dom_BodyAcc_mean_Y (numeric variable):## takes values between -1 and 1. It’s the average of the tBodyAcc-mean()-Y variable of the original data set.

## Average_Time_Dom_BodyAcc_mean_Z (numeric variable):## takes values between -1 and 1. It’s the average of the tBodyAcc-mean()-Z variable of the original data set.

## Average_Time_Dom_BodyAcc_std_X (numeric variable):##  takes values between -1 and 1. It’s the average of the tBodyAcc-std()-X variable of the original data set.

## Average_Time_Dom_BodyAcc_std_Y (numeric variable):##  takes values between -1 and 1. It’s the average of the tBodyAcc-std()-Y variable of the original data set.

## Average_Time_Dom_BodyAcc_std_Z (numeric variable):##  takes values between -1 and 1. It’s the average of the tBodyAcc-std()-Z variable of the original data set.

## Average_tGravityAcc_mean_X (numeric variable):##  takes values between -1 and 1. It’s the average of the tGravityAcc-mean()-X variable of the original data set.

## Average_tGravityAcc_mean_Y (numeric variable):##  takes values between -1 and 1. It’s the average of the tGravityAcc-mean()-Y variable of the original data set.
